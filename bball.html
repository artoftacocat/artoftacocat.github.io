    <p>{Click the ball!!!} June 16th, 2018.This is my fav chicken pic I'v ever drawn. When I drew it, I had also drawn a pic of my brother playing basketball,so it's kind of a pic of him. I also think that he qualifies as a chicken [My brother says that he is not a chicken. He says that he is a fire-breathing dragon]. <br> <span class="indent">-Tacocat</span> </p>
