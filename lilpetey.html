    <p>June 21st, 2018. This is a pic of Lil Petey. If you've read the book<br>
        Dog Man,[by Dav Pilkey] you'll know who he is. In the book, this <br>
        villan named Petey duplicates himself [for no apparent reason] but <br>
        his clone is a cute baby vershon of him who is best friends with <br>
        the good guy, Dog Man. It's a really cute story, and I recomend <br>
        reading it.<br>
