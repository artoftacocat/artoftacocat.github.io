    <h1>The Art of Tacocat</h1>

    <p>June 18th, 2018. Hi.It's Tacocat. By the way, I did not name myself
      "Tacocat" after the band Tacocat. Dude, I only found out their was a band
       named Tacocat yesterday. I named myself Tacocat after a cute card in the
        game Exploding Kittens[which, by the way, you can order on Amazon].
        Anyway, I'm going to post my art [which my dad has animated]on here with
         comments regulararly so you guys can see them. Hope you like them!!!!
